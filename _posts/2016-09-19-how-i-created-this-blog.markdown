In present days blog is a very effective way to express the thoughts created inside mind. I am also starting to explore 
this medium to see how this can be dome. My first post in this blog is also about the same. Explaining `How I created this 
blog`.

This blog site uses

* Github Pages for hosting
* Jekyll blog-aware static content generator
* Markdown text markup for post writing
* Textile text markup maybe used for post writing but not using now
* Bootstrap CSS library for layout
